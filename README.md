## About

This is a repository for my personal website hosted at https://www.jjgry.com

### Built With

* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com)
* [Apache](https://httpd.apache.org/)

## Getting started

The website is mostly plain HTML but I utilise Apache's SSI to load the header and footer to avoid code duplication. 

No special tools are required to edit the codebase but you will need to an Apache HTTP server to preview any changes.

## Roadmap

See the [open issues](https://github.com/jjgry/website-static/issues) for a list of proposed features (and known issues).
